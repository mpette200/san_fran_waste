    "## Machine Learning - Garbage Cleaning in San Francisco\n",
    "\n",
    "This project attempts to apply machine learning to a data set containing details collected when garbage receptacles have been reported as overflowing. The data is publicly available from (https://datasf.org).\n",
    "\n",
    "Possible business cases might be:\n",
    "- Is it possible to predict locations and times when receptacles get full? This could help in assigning crews.\n",
    "- Some reports turn out to be false, might be useful if this could be predicted.\n",
    "- Do weather conditions have any effect? (Extra project to compare with weather data)\n",
